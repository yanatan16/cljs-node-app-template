# Clojurescript Node App Template

A minimalistic Leiningen template for Clojurescript-based node apps.

It supports creating node binaries, libraries, and regular projects.
It sets up testing infrastructure using `cljs.test` and [lein-doo](https://github.com/bensu/doo).

It is currently not entirely documented, but I'll try to work on that in the coming months.

## Usage

```sh
lein new cljs-node-app my-app
```
